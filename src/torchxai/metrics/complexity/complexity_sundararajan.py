    Args:
        attributions (Tuple[Tensor,...]): A tuple of tensors representing attributions of separate inputs. Each
            tensor in the tuple has shape (batch_size, num_features).
        eps (float): The threshold value for attributions to be considered important.
        normalize_attribution (bool): If True, the attributions are normalized to sum to 1.
        is_multi_target (bool, optional): A boolean flag that indicates whether the metric computation is for
                multi-target explanations. if set to true, the targets are required to be a list of integers
                each corresponding to a required target class in the output. The corresponding metric outputs
                are then returned as a list of metric outputs corresponding to each target class.
                Default is False.
        return_dict (bool, optional): A boolean flag that indicates whether the metric outputs are returned as a dictionary
                with keys as the metric names and values as the corresponding metric outputs.

                input example. The first dimension is equal to the
